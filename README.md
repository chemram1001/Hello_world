Hi Fellow Earthlings, 

My name is Ramces and I want create technology to become immortal.
This is a seemingly complex issue but it is actually quite simple.
For one thing, the cell is really the building block of life.
We know how to repair computers and how they operate, so luckly for 
us, the cell operates much like a computer (a biological one that is).
At core of the cell is the nucleus, both literally and figuatively. 
This is where the software is stored in the form of DNA, whereas software of
computers are stored in magnetic disks or DDRAM. However, each gene is activated
to execute a program in the form of a protein blueprint which is taken to the 
cytoplasm to be built (compiled) by RNA molecules. There is more to this scheme
of course, but the main reason here is that life could be treated like a computer
and doing so could help solve many problems that have evaded even the most
brilliant of minds.
